			<p id="interesting-facts" class="background">Expression "cry crocodile tears" is based on the true fact - crocodiles produce tears when they eat. They don't cry because they feel sorry for the prey, but because they swallow too much air, which gets in touch with lachrymal glands (glands that produce tears) and forces tears to flow.</p>
